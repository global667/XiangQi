### Overview

Chameleon is a free, powerful UCI Chinese Chess (also called XiangQi) engine derived from [Stockfish 7](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish). It is not a complete chess program and requires a UCI-compatible GUI (e.g. [Sylvan](https://github.com/EterCyber/Sylvan)) in order to be used comfortably. Read the documentation for your GUI of choice for information about how to use Chameleon with it.
